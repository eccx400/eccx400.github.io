									<h3>Who am I?</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/me2.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Eric Cheng, and I am a recent graduate in Computer Science from Santa Clara University
										in California, USA.  I was born in Taipei, Taiwan, but spent most of my life in the United States with a brief interlude in Beijing, China.
										In the past few years I have had experience with various programming projects
										and languages (<b>C/C++</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>,etc).
										I have also emmersed myself in modules such as <b>Pandas xlsxwriter</b> for parsing and analyzing python files,
										<b>Qt Quick</b> for developing a working user interface, and TCP in Ubuntu for remote transfer of log files.</p>
									
									<hr />

									<h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/code.jpg" alt="" /></span>My passions are rooted in technological innovation, social responsibility, and collaboration. My
										past experience included being an intern at the VA Palo Alto hospital, developing data analytic 
										algorithms to scrape patient feedback from the hospital provided opinion forms and social media 
										opened my eyes to the profound impact of natural language processing in healthcare analytics. 
										Recently, I have been working to develop a Python application to automate ADDS (Adult Deterioration
										Detection System) chart modeling and trend analysis on incoming patient data by performing machine
										learning algorithms on patientsâ€™ four vitals during their stay in the ICU. My goal is to develop
										a user dashboard which automatically generates graphical displays and interprets abnormal patient
										observations, effectively allowing medical professionals to monitor and visualize patient
										deterioration without the unnecessary cognitive effort needed to interpret traditional
										observation charts.

									<h3>Other facts about me</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/travel.jpg" alt="" /></span>Having spent a portion of my life abroad, I was exposed to cultural influences that have shaped me
									   into who I am today. I am an avid traveler, always abiding by my motto "traveling should be fun, not
									   stressful". My preference of solo tripping allows me to do that, I like exploring places off the
									   beaten track, and seeing things other tourists simply don't see.</p>
									   
									<p>In my spare time, I enjoy practicing my hobbies and conducting physical exercises. I am a huge fan of
										Go (also known as Weiqi), which is an ancient board game that while seemingly simple to play, is one
										of the most complex strategic games to ever be developed. Go challenges a player's intuition, memory,
										problem-solving, and decision making skills. For most of my childhood, Go was an important part of my life,
										and I even earned a rank of 1-dan through competitions organized by the Chinese Go Association during my life in China. I have
										also been following AI developments in Go technology, especially the reknowned DeepMind AlphaGo. To those
										who are willing to give it a try, you can play the game online <a href= "https://www.cosumi.net/play.html">here</a>.
										Have fun!</p>
